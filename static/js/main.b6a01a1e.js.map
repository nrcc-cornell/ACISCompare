Click <img src={helpIcon} alt=\"help\" height=\"12\" /> above to get assistance finding a station's GHCN id or visit <a href=\"http://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt\" target=\"_blank\">https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/ghcnd-stations.txt</a> to view a complete list of stations. When a valid id is entered, the station name and period of record for the selected variable will appear next to the station number entry box. A station's entire period of record can be obtained using this tool. However, for best browser performance it is recommended that shorter periods (around 10 years or less) are requested at a time. Progress on a request is displayed in the first line of the output column headers.</p>\n    <p>This tool uses the NCEI's Access Data Service to obtain the data from GHCN-Daily. ACIS Web Services are used to obtain data from the ACIS datasets. </p>\n    <p>The ACIS database consists of a number of source datasets.

When these differences occur, they are displayed in a red font in the table. The main reasons for differences include:</p>\n    <ul>\n    <li>GHCN-Daily retains values that failed quality control along with a flag that indicates the reason for failure. ACIS displays these as missing values,</li>\n    <li>ACIS does not include GHCN-Daily's HPRCC real-time data source (H).

For instance, for precipitation, the GHCN-Daily elements PRCP, MDPR, and DAPR are all queried.
